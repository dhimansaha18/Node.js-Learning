# Node.js-Learning
I'm learning node.js for the first time. It's a very popular backend technology that is being used by many companies throughout the world.
Eventually, we might forget some things that we've learned. I'll be uploading all of my node.js learnings here so that I can give them a go whenever I can't re-collect anything.
